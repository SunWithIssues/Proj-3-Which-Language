# Which Language - Coding Project for CS141

### Project Description
Uses analysis of already known language documents (that is Macbeth in 9 languages: English, Finnish, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Esperanto) to find an alphabetic frequency counts for each language. 
The frequency counts are then used to correctly guess which language is given when the language is unknown.
This project was originally done during my CS141 class at UIC.

### Changes From UIC Project
I made some slight changes from the original UIC project. Added the Esperanto language. The information gathered from known language documents are not visible to the user, anymore. 
The user's only interaction is giving the unknown language, and the computer responded with a guess.

### Program Environment
The program was originally written for the Codio environment (codio.com). It can work in the Dev-C++. I believe there should be no real restrictions with other environments, though I have not checked.
